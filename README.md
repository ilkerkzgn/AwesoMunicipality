# Project Name

AwesoMunicipality - Ankara

## The Goal of the Project

 It’s a complaint app that helps citizens to send their complaints to directly the municipality without giving extra informations (eg. Turkish Citizen ID). Users will only authenticate themselves one time in a very fast way and they can send their complaints after it. Citizens will have plenty of options to select (eg. Light or Road problem) and they will capture a photo of the problem with a location. In this way, the municipality can identify the location of the problem and solve it immediately. Our project is targeting Android devices and will run only those devices. It’s the most common operating system and we believe it will help to popularize our application.
